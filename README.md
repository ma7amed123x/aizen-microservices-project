# üéüÔ∏è Ticket Buying Backend System

A microservices-based backend for booking and managing event tickets, built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Keycloak**, **MySQL**, and **Docker**.  
This project demonstrates scalable microservice communication, centralized authentication, and fault tolerance with **Resilience4j**.

## üß© Architecture Overview

The system follows a **microservices architecture**, where each module handles a specific responsibility:

| Service | Description | Port |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **API Gateway** | Routes client requests to the appropriate microservice and secures them via Keycloak. | `8090` |
| **Inventory Service** | Manages events and ticket availability. | `8081` |
| **Booking Service** | Handles ticket reservations and booking operations. | `8082` |
| **Keycloak** | Authentication and authorization server (OpenID Connect). | `9090` |
| **MySQL** | Database used by microservices and Keycloak. | `3306` |
| **Kafka + Zookeeper** | Enables asynchronous event communication between services. | `9092`, `2181` |
